# Classification models and cluster analyzes for the purchase intention of users of e-commerce platforms

Understanding how users' online activities influence their purchase likelihood is crucial for gaining insights into their motivations. Numerous studies in the academic space highlight the global expansion of the Internet contributing to the rise of e-commerce. Online stores are preferred over traditional brick-and-mortar establishments due to their enhanced accessibility, convenience, privacy, and extensive product variety (Schaupp and Belanger, 2005; Vijayasarathy, 2004; Jain et al., 2021; Rahayu et al., 2017)

__The main objectives of this project are:__

1.Explore novel classification models to predict purchase intentions.

2.Identify key factors within the best-performing model that significantly influence purchase intentions.

3.Group users into distinct categories based on their time spent on specific pages and exit rates.

The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from the Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention dataset provided by UC Irvineâ€™s Machine Learning Repository. Each session in the dataset corresponds to a different user within a one-year period, ensuring diversity and avoiding bias towards specific campaigns, special days, user profiles, or seasons. The dataset comprises 18 features: 7 numerical and 11 categorical, and it includes a total of 12,330 entries.
